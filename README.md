Contactless energy or wireless power transfer is a technology that allows energy to be transferred from one device to another without the need for physical contact. This technology is still in its early stages, but it could revolutionize the way we use and transport energy. It could potentially make charging devices easier and safer, reduce the need for electrical cords, and reduce the cost and complexity of powering small devices. Some of the potential applications of this technology include powering electric vehicles, powering mobile devices, and providing electricity in remote locations.


## Use case


### Wearable Devices

Wireless low-power transfer technology can be used to power wearable devices such as fitness trackers, smart watches, and medical devices. This technology can be used to provide a continuous power source for these devices, allowing them to operate without the need for frequent battery replacements.


### Internet of Things (IoT)

Wireless low-power transfer technology can be used to power Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as sensors, connected home appliances, and smart meters. This technology can provide a reliable power source for these devices, allowing them to be located in areas without access to conventional power sources.


### Industrial Automation

Wireless low-power transfer technology can be used to power industrial automation systems, such as robots and automated production lines. This technology can provide a reliable power source for these systems, allowing them to operate without the need for frequent battery replacements.
