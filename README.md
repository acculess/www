Contactless energy or wireless power transfer is a technology that allows energy to be transferred from one device to another without the need for physical contact. This technology is still in its early stages, but it could revolutionize the way we use and transport energy. It could potentially make charging devices easier and safer, reduce the need for electrical cords, and reduce the cost and complexity of powering small devices. Some of the potential applications of this technology include powering electric vehicles, powering mobile devices, and providing electricity in remote locations.
