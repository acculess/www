## About Technology


Contactless energy or wireless power transfer is a technology that allows energy to be transferred from one device to another without the need for physical contact. This technology is still in its early stages, but it could revolutionize the way we use and transport energy. It could potentially make charging devices easier and safer, reduce the need for electrical cords, and reduce the cost and complexity of powering small devices. Some of the potential applications of this technology include powering electric vehicles, powering mobile devices, and providing electricity in remote locations.


Scientists are looking for new ways to power electronic devices like phones, health monitors, and environmental sensors. Instead of using batteries, they want to use energy from things like sunlight, heat, vibrations, and electricity. They are using really tiny materials called nanomaterials to make these new power sources. They are also finding ways to make these power sources really small, so they can be used in tiny devices like sensors. Some of the new power sources are made from special materials that can turn vibrations into electricity. Others use special materials that can turn heat or sunlight into electricity. These new power sources are important because they are more sustainable and better for the environment than using batteries.

Energy harvesting from living environment Provides a powerful alternative to rechargeable batteries; sustainable and affordable energy sources. Not as consistent as batteries; some sources may not be available in all locations. 
Nanomaterials Can create unique properties; can be used to power devices. Still in the research and development phase; expensive to produce. 
Third-generation solar cells Intrinsic advantages of dimension and tunability; cost-effective and scalable. Still in the research and development phase; may not work in all conditions. 
Thermoelectric materials Provides an alternative energy to fossil fuels; can harvest heat dissipated from humans. Improvements still needed to increase the figure of merit of organic materials. 
Vibrational energy harnessing Can provide continuous and changing operational need of sensors/electronic devices. May not be as consistent as other energy sources; not all systems have vibrations at the right frequency. 
Electrostatic energy harvesting Breakthrough research is happening for capacitors that can store a large amount of energy and then release it almost instantaneously. Difficult to achieve with other energy storage technologies such as batteries or ultracapacitors. 
Electromagnetic harvesters Easy to design and high reliability. Miniaturization has proven to be challenging. 
Piezoelectric energy harnessing Can turn mechanical stress into electricity. Need an optimal design to output the highest harvested power possible over the smallest area feasible.

Overall, each energy harvesting solution has its own benefits and disadvantages. Energy harvesting from our living environment provides a sustainable and affordable alternative to rechargeable batteries, but may not be as consistent as batteries. Nanomaterials can create unique properties and power devices, but are still in the research and development phase and can be expensive to produce.

Wireless Power / Charging

Acculess embedded wireless power technology provides long-range, true wireless charging without wires or charging mats to enable completely untethered devices. 
FCC-approved RF transmitters pair with high-efficiency receiver chips to enable power-over-distance recharging of multiple devices.

A transmitter sends RF energy over the air to a receiver chip embedded in a device, which converts it to DC to recharge its batteries or directly power the device. This remote charging technology behaves like Wi-Fi where enabled devices automatically charge when within range of a power transmitter.  
Smart, configurable and controllable, it can automatically activate when devices need charging and turn off when they’re done, or can deliver power continuously or on a scheduled basis.


## How it work's

A wireless energy transfer system can be implemented for a range of 100 meters using a rectenna for the 5.8GHz frequency band. The system consists of a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter is configured to transfer 1mW of energy from a source to the receiver using a directional antenna with a beamwidth of approximately 10 degrees. The receiver is equipped with a rectenna that is tuned to the 5.8GHz frequency band for maximum efficiency. The rectenna is able to convert the RF energy into usable DC power for the device. The system is designed to be able to provide a stable and reliable connection between the transmitter and the receiver up to a range of 100 meters.
